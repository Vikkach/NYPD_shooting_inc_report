# NYPD Shooting Incident Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze data from NYPD shooting incidents spanning from 2006 to 2022 to understand safety concerns for young women in New York City. By investigating high-risk locations, times, and correlations between incidents and murders across boroughs, the goal is to provide insights that can inform strategies to enhance safety and security.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

* Exact date and time of the shooting incident
* Borough where the shooting incident occurred
* Victim's age, sex, and race
* Indicator if the shooting resulted in the victim's death, counted as murder
  
## Analysis Highlights

**Spatial Disparities:** The analysis reveals significant differences in safety across NYC boroughs, with Brooklyn identified as the most dangerous and Staten Island as the safest.
**Temporal Patterns:** Incidents peak between 8 pm and 4 am, indicating a higher risk during nighttime hours.
**Correlation:** There's a clear correlation between shooting incidents and murders, particularly pronounced in Brooklyn.
**Safe Time:** Interestingly, the safest time appears to be during daylight hours.

## Recommendations

* Increase police presence and community outreach programs, especially during high-risk times and in areas with a higher incidence of shootings.
* Implement targeted interventions to address underlying factors contributing to violence, particularly in high-risk boroughs like Brooklyn.
* Enhance safety measures during nighttime hours, such as improved street lighting and surveillance.
  
## Potential Bias

Geographical factors, urban infrastructure, and policing strategies may introduce biases into the analysis.
Variations in community resources and neighborhood characteristics across boroughs could impact observed correlations.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the importance of targeted interventions to address safety concerns for young women in New York City. By understanding spatial and temporal patterns of violence, authorities can implement effective strategies to create a safer environment for all residents.
